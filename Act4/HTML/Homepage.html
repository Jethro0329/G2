    <h1>What is Waste Management?</h1>

    <p>
      Waste Management is the process of collecting, transporting, treating, and disposing of waste in a way that minimizes its negative impacts on the environment and human health. 
      Waste can be solid, liquid, or gas, and it can come from various sources, such as households, industries, businesses, and agriculture. 
      Waste management involves different methods, such as waste segregation, composting, recycling, incineration, landfilling, and waste-to-energy. 
      Waste management is important for conserving natural resources, saving money, creating jobs, improving public health, and supporting sustainable development.

      We also need to support and cooperate with the local authorities and waste management service providers, and advocate for better waste management policies and infrastructure.
